## About me: 
Former UX/UI designer who wants to learn new technologies and help people to live simpler life. I used to work as a UX/UI designer but realised that coding and fixing bugs are more catching to me than testing hypotheses about users' behavior. Though I still know how to make product responsive and user-friendly for people.
